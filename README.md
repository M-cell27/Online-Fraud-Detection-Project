## Introduction

The aim of this project is to build a fraud detection system to identify potentially fraudulent financial transactions. The dataset used for this project contains a mix of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The main steps involved in the project include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
fraud_detection_project/
  |- data/
     |- fraud_data.csv
  |- notebooks/
     |- fraud_detection_analysis.ipynb
  |- src/
     |- data_preprocessing.py
     |- model_training.py
     |- evaluation.py
  |- config.py
  |- README.md
```

- The `data` directory contains the dataset used for the project.
- The `notebooks` directory contains the Jupyter Notebook file for the project.
- The `src` directory contains the Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- The `config.py` file contains project-specific configurations and parameters.

## Data Source
